The Price Negotiator Chatbot project is an innovative e-commerce solution featuring a custom-built chatbot. The chatbot guides users through browsing product categories, selecting items, and negotiating prices interactively. The frontend, built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, offers an intuitive interface, while the backend leverages a Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm to predict and provide dynamic price discounts. This system combines personalized interaction and AI-driven price negotiation to deliver a seamless and engaging shopping experience.
